## Reset Button Help

There's a Reset button on the bottom.
It should never need to be used but is still there just in case.

There are two holes on the bottom, under the left and right edges of the Dot 7 key.
Both of these are very hard to feel because they're very small.
They're about a quarter of an inch in from the front.

The hole toward the left gives access to the Reset button.
You can use an unbent paper clip to press it.
Before pressing it, make sure you first carefully feel for the center of the button.
Pressing it cuts off power to the PC board.

The hole toward the right gives access to the USB-Boot button,
which lets the unit be booted as a memory device (kind of like a USB stick).
Doing this requires special software - rpiboot - to be on your computer.
It's how we flash the Raspbian operating system onto the BTSpeak.
This button must be held while the BTSpeak's power is turned on.
You can google this if it interests you.
One web page that describes this process is:
