## Desktop Navigation Help

The chords used to navigate the BTSpeak Desktop are listed below.  
These bindings assume that the Mate session manager is being used.

The PC keyboard key combination for each binding is also listed (within parentheses) for those who are familiar with them.
The Super key, used in some of the bindings, might not be familiar to some - it's commonly also known by other names such as the Windows or Command key.
