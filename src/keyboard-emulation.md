PC Keyboard Emulation Help

When running third-party applications, such as those outside of the BTSpeak user interface, it's important
to know how to emulate the special keys of a PC keyboard.
This is how:
  * Enter: 8
  * Backspace: 7 (or B-Chord)
  * Tab: 4-5-Chord
  * Arrow Left: 3-Chord
  * Arrow Right: 6-Chord
  * Arrow Up: 1-Chord
  * Arrow Down: 4-Chord
  * Page Up: 2-3-Chord
  * Page Down: 5-6-Chord
  * Home: 1-3-Chord
  * End: 4-6-Chord
  * Insert: 3-5-Chord (lower i)
  * Delete: 2-5-6-Chord (lower d)
  * Escape: 2-6-Chord (lower e)

To type an uppercase letter, add Dot 7 to its lowercase representation.
To type a control character, add both Dot 7 and Dot 8 to its lowercase representation.

Sticky modifier keys are activated by pressing 8-Chord + one of the other seven dot keys (1-7):
  * 1: the GUI modifier (aka Windows, Command)
  * 2: the Left Alt modifier (aka Meta)
  * 3: the Control modifier
  * 4: the Shift modifier
  * 5: the Right Alt modifier (aka AltGr)
  * 6: the Uppercase modifier
  * 7: reset all of the sticky modifiers

Pressing a modifier once enables it for just the next typed character; the BTSpeak will say "once".
Pressing it again (so, twice) locks it so that it applies to every character typed from then on; the BTSpeak will say "lock".
Pressing it yet again (so, thrice) resets it so that it no longer applies; the BTSpeak will say "off".

If a modifier has been enabled for just the next character then
it's automatically reset after a few seconds if nothing else is typed; the BTSpeak will say "modifiers reset".

X-Chord, the legacy binding for the Control modifier, is supported.
It works exactly the same as 3-8-Chord (described above).

U-Chord, the legacy binding for the Uppercase modifier, is supported.
It works exactly the same as 6-8-Chord (described above).
