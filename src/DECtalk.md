## DECtalk Help

We're grateful to Human Voice LLC for having allowed us to include
the DECtalk text-to-speech engine, free of charge, within the BTSpeak.

To switch between eSpeak NG and DECtalk:
1. Open the options menu and navigate to "System", "System Administration", "Settings", or type O-Chord, S, S, S.
1. Select "Text to Speech Settings."
1. Choose from either of the following options:
  * Use eSpeak NG
  * Use DECtalk

The change is immediate - you won't need to reboot.

If you select DECtalk but it is unable to run on the BTSpeak, the unit will speak an error and continue using eSpeak NG as before.
