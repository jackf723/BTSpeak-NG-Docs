## Product Description Help

The BTSpeak, created by Blazie Technologies, is a hand-held computer designed for the visually impaired. It sports a standard 8-dot Braille keyboard for input and uses synthetic speech for output. To turn it on, briefly press the slightly recessed power button on the machine's right edge. The machine will vibrate briefly, and within 30 seconds will say, "BTSpeak ready." Press the button briefly to put the unit in sleep mode, or press and hold for two seconds to shut it down entirely.

Along the back edge are three ports. The farthest plug on the left is a mini-HDMI connector (used to connect the BTSpeak to a television or computer monitor). Second in from the left is a standard USB C port which allows you to connect a power supply, USB headphones, external storage, and other accessories. The final slot on the back of the unit is a micro-SD card slot.

The front face of the BTSpeak is largely taken up with the 8-dot Braille keyboard. From back to front you will find Dot 3, Dot 2, Dot 1, Dot 4, Dot 5, and Dot 6. Below these keys are Dot 7, the spacebar, and Dot 8. The remaining space of the front face contains a pair of small stereo speakers from which sound emanates and a microphone for recording notes, dictation, and issuing voice commands.

Many BTSpeak commands use what are called "chords."
A chord is simply a command that involves use of the spacebar.
For example, when you are asked to press an O-Chord, what we mean is to press the letter O (1, 3, and 5) and the spacebar together.
Z-7-Chord means to press the letter Z (1-3-5-6), 7, and the Spacebar.
We also describe letters and commands using dot numbers. For example, the letter A is 1, B is 1-2, C is 1-4, and so on.

The BTSpeak's editor is a modified version of the nano editor (which is available on all Linux distributions).
It's a simple but powerful editor that uses a TUI (text-based user interface) as opposed to a GUI (graphical user interface).
All of the programs on the BTSpeak use a text interface, which has traditionally been much easier for a blind person to use.

Nano was written for a qwerty keyboard.
We have augmented some of its key bindings, therefore, in order to conform more closely to the BTSpeak's braille keyboard.
For example, we use F-Chord for the find command, whereas the editor uses Control-W, because the Braille 'n Speak and many products for the blind use F-Chord for find.
For another example, we use M-Chord to set the mark whereas the editor uses Alt-A.

Unlike most notetakers, like the Braille 'n Speak, the editor can have many files open at the same time.
You can cycle through them with 5-6-8-Chord (forward one file) and 2-3-7-Chord (back one file).
When you open a file with O-Chord F, it adds a new buffer in the circular ring of files.
To close a file, take it out of the file ring by pressing O-Chord F Q.
