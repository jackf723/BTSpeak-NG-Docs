## Power Button Help

The power button is located near the front of the right side between two bumps.
Note that these bumps are there to protect against accidental pressing of the power button,
and that neither of them is a button in its own right.

### If the BTSpeak is off:

Briefly pressing the power button will cause it to start booting.
You can release the power button as soon as you feel a short vibration;
you should feel it almost immediately.
If you don't feel it then the battery is probably empty.
If you don't feel it but are sure that the battery is charged
then you may need to do the unthinkable - pressing the Reset button!

### If the BTSpeak is on:

When you press the power button, you'll feel a short vibration.
If you continue to hold it for three seconds,
you'll feel a longer vibration and the BTSpeak will shut down.
Pressing the power button for less than three seconds will
alternate the BTSpeak between being asleep and being awake.
An announcement telling you which of these two states is being entered
is made when the power button is released.
