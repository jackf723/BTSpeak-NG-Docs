## Stopwatch Help

This program functions as both a traditional stopwatch and countdown timer.
In stopwatch mode, the program begins counting up from 0 seconds until you tell it to stop.
In countdown mode, the program counts down from a set number of minutes and seconds until the time you specify has elapsed.

Use the following keys to operate the stopwatch:
  * Start and stop: 6
  * Reset: 3
  * Hear time elapsed: Space
  * Repeat last reading: C
  * Start countdown timer: 3-4-5-6
  * Exit: Z-Chord

When using the countdown timer, you will be asked for minutes and seconds.
Type each value separately using Computer Braille (that is, numbers in the lower half of the cell and no number-sign).
You will receive spoken and vibration alerts at 30, 20, 15, 10, 3, and 1 minute intervals,
50, 40, 30, 20, 15, and 10 second intervals,
followed by an alert every second until the time reaches 0.

Note: the program does not currently run in the background. This is planned for a future update.
