## Vibration Patterns Help

If the BTSpeak is off then you'll feel a short vibration
when you press its power button to let you know that it has started booting.
You can let go of the power button as soon as you feel this vibration.
If you don't feel this vibration then the battery is probably empty
and you'll need to charge it.

If the BTSpeak is on then these are its vibration patterns and their meanings:
  * 1 short: power button pressed
  * 2 shorts: battery transition from okay to low
  * 3 shorts: battery is empty
  * 1 medium: power button held - shutdown
  * 2 Mediums: battery transition from low to okay
  * 3 Mediums: battery is fully charged
  * medium short: power button released - sleeping
  * short medium: power button released - awake
  * 1 long: shutdown complete - power off

When a long operation, e.g. a system upgrade or connecting to a Wi-Fi network,
is being performed then the vibrator is pulsed once per second as an indicator
to let you know that the BTSpeak is still alive and well.
