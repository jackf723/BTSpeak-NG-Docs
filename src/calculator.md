## Calculator Help

When you enter this general-purpose mathematical calculator, you'll be on its expression prompt.  
Enter whatever you'd like to calculate and press *dot 8* (which functions as the equals sign).  
You'll then be on the result line.  
You can go down one line with *4-Chord* to see the expression that was calculated.  
You can then go back up to the result with *1-Chord*.  
You can dismiss the result and go back to the expression prompt with *8*.
Z-Chord, when on the expression prompt, exits the calculator.

Expressions are entered, with a few exceptions, using Nemeth Code symbols.
In the following lists, the key being described is shown first, followed by the dots to press to type it.

   * the digit 1: 2
   * the digit 2: 2-3
   * the digit 3: 2-5
   * the digit 4: 2-5-6
   * the digit 5: 2-6
   * the digit 6: 2-3-5
   * the digit 7: 2-3-5-6
   * the digit 8: 2-3-6
   * the digit 9: 3-5
   * the digit 0: 3-5-6
   * the decimal point: 4-6
   * plus: 3-4-6
   * minus: 3-6
   * times: 1-6
   * divide: 3-4
   * remainder: 1-4-6
   * exponentiate (to the power of): 4-5-7
   * left parenthesis: 1-2-3-5-6
   * right parenthesis: 2-3-4-5-6
   * a space: spacebar

These key combinations can be used to edit the expression:
   * go to the previous character: 3-Chord
   * go to the next character: 6-Chord
   * go to the first character: 1-3-Chord
   * go to the end (just after the last character): 4-6-Chord
   * delete the previous character: 7
   * delete the current character: 2-5-6-Chord
   * delete all of the previous characters: 1-3-6-7-8

A number must not contain a space and may be entered to any precision both before and after the decimal point.
The decimal point is optional and is not required if all digits after the point are 0.

The special variable "last" contains the result of the previous calculation.
You can define your own variables by entering lines of the form:
  variable = expression

Standard operator precedence rules are used.
From highest to lowest:
  * a subexpression within parentheses
  * negation
  * exponentiation
  * times, divide, remainder
  * plus, minus
