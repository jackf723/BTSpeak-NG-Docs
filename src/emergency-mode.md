## Emergency Mode Help

Emergency mode invokes an interactive shell in which complex system maintenance can be performed.
It runs a minimal system in which the only processes that are running are the service manager (PID 1) and the shell itself.

This mode allows starting units individually in order to continue the boot process in steps.
It's safe to perform file system maintenance when in this mode.
