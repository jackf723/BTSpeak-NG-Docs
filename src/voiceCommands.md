## Voice Commands

Your BTSpeak allows you to run several functions using your voice. 
Current supported functions include:
* Get local weather
* Define a word in the dictionary
* Show the BTSpeak battery level
* ShowWiFi connections

Select Voice-commands from the options menu to initiate a voice command. *Z-chord* will exit this mode.

After running Voice-commands, wait for the tone and then speak the command corresponding to the function you would like to perform. The second tone indicates the end of the listening period. If the command is understood, its function will run after a brief pause. If the command is not understood, you will be presented with the message, "command not intelligible". 
Below is a list of supported commands and their corresponding functions.

Voice Phrase | Function
--- | ---
"Define 'word'" | Looks up a word in the dictionary
"Weather" | Speaks the local weather conditions
"Battery" | Opens the battery menu and speaks the battery level
"WiFi" | Opens the WiFi menu and shows available networks

Your device will recognize any command containing the command keyword you would like to run. For example, "*weather*", "get the *weather*", and "what are my *weather* conditions now?" will all speak the weather since the "weather" keyword was included in the command.
