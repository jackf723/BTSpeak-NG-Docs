## Gregorian Date Calculator Help

The date calculator allows you to calculate the day of the week of a past or future date in three ways:
1.  By entering the number of days (starting from the current date). An optional plus sign *(Dots 3-4-6)* at the beginning means you want to look forward, while a minus *(Dots 3-6)* means you want to look back.
1.  By entering a specific date either in the form MMDDYY or MMDDYYYY, where MM represents the month, DD the day, and YY or YYYY the year.
1.  By entering a number-sign (Dots 3-4-5-6) to hear the day number of the current year.

All numbers should be entered using Computer Braille (that is, dropped numbers with no number-sign).
When finished, press *8* to hear the date.
If the date calculator was not able to understand what you entered, it responds with "invalid input."

Some examples:
1.  To find the date 30 days from now, enter 30 or +30.
1.  To find the date 500 days ago, enter -500.
1.  To learn which day of the week occurred on July 4, 1776, type 07041776.
1.  To learn when January 1, 1995 occurred, enter either 010195 or 01011995.
1.  To find the number of days since the current year began, enter the number-sign. January 1 is day 1, while December 31 is day 365.
