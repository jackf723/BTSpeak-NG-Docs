## How to Get an OpenAI Key

You'll need to generate your own OpenAI key in order to use apps like ChatGPT.
Go to (https://platform.openai.com/api/)  
create an account, and log in.
In the top-right corner of the page, use the dropdown menu and select the option to generate a new API key.
Copy this key to a new text file, save it as ".openAPI_key", and place it in the home directory on the BTSpeak.
